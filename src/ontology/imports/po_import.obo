def: "A microsporangium that is part of a sporophyll and where the pollen grains develop and are located after they develop." [POC:curators]
comment: A pollen sac is a microsporangium in seed plants. In angiosperms, a single, unfused pollen sac may contain an anther locule or several pollen sacs may fuse so they contain a single anther locule. If you are annotating to this structure for Zea mays or other grasses, please also add an annotation to the corresponding floret type. Choose the most specific term possible from: spikelet floret (PO:0009082), tassel floret (PO:0006310), lower floret of pedicellate spikelet of tassel (PO:0006313), lower floret of sessile spikelet of tassel (PO:0006315), upper floret of pedicellate spikelet of tassel (PO:0006314), upper floret of sessile spikelet of tassel (PO:0006316).

comment: A whole plant (PO:0000003) in the sporophyte development stage usually has twice the chromosome complement of a plant in the gametophytic phase, but may not in the case of apogamy. Examples of apogamy include both naturally occurring instances (such as sporophytes arising form haploid cells as in bryophytes or ferns) as well as in vitro instances (such as haploid embryo culture or in vitro fusion of non-gamete cells or protoplasts). During the sporophyte development stage, a plant may produce meiospores by meiosis.

comment: Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains.
